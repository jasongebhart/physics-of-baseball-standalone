## Running Tests

### Local Development (with browser visible)
```bash
# Run all regression tests with browser visible (cross-platform)
npm run test:headed

# Windows-specific (if cross-env not available)
npm run test:headed:win

# Run specific test file with browser visible
set HEADED=true && npx playwright test tests/regression/homepage-navigation.spec.js

# Run with debug mode (slower, with tracing)
npx playwright test --project=debug

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=regression-chromium
```

### CI/CD (headless mode)
```bash
# Run all regression tests (headless, cross-platform)
npm run test:ci

# Windows-specific (if cross-env not available)
npm run test:ci:win

# Direct command with environment variable
set CI=true && npx playwright test tests/regression/
```

### Quick Testing Commands
```bash
# Run only homepage tests
npx playwright test homepage-navigation

# Run only mobile tests
npx playwright test --project=regression-mobile-chrome

# Run with live HTML reporter
npx playwright test --reporter=html --headed

# Run failed tests only
npx playwright test --last-failed
```

## Test Configuration

The test suite is configured via `playwright.config.js` with the following projects:

- **regression-chromium**: Desktop Chrome regression tests
- **regression-firefox**: Desktop Firefox regression tests
- **regression-webkit**: Desktop Safari regression tests
- **regression-mobile-chrome**: Mobile Chrome tests
- **regression-mobile-safari**: Mobile Safari tests
- **user-flows**: Original user flow tests
- **debug**: Debug mode with slow motion and full tracing

## Environment Variables

- `CI=true`: Enables headless mode, retries, and CI-specific reporting
- `HEADED=true`: Forces browser to be visible (overrides CI setting)
- `PWTEST_HTML_REPORT_OPEN=never`: Prevents auto-opening HTML report

## Test Data and Fixtures

Tests use realistic data and scenarios:
- Week completion simulation via localStorage
- Form validation with invalid/valid inputs
- Touch interactions on mobile devices
- Progress tracking across multiple weeks
- Error state handling

## Debugging Failed Tests

1. **View HTML Report**: `npx playwright show-report`
2. **Run with Debug Mode**: `npx playwright test --project=debug failing-test.spec.js`
3. **View Screenshots**: Check `test-results/` directory
4. **Trace Viewer**: `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`

## Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in `tests/regression/`
2. Follow naming convention: `feature-name.spec.js`
3. Include accessibility and responsive tests
4. Add cross-browser compatibility checks
5. Document new test coverage in this README

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are designed to run in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar CI/CD platforms:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Regression Tests
  run: |
    npx playwright install
    CI=true npx playwright test tests/regression/

- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

## Test Maintenance

- Tests are designed to be resilient to minor UI changes
- Uses semantic selectors (roles, labels) over brittle CSS selectors
- Includes fallback strategies for optional elements
- Self-healing with graceful degradation for missing features

## Performance Benchmarks

- Homepage load: < 3 seconds
- Week navigation: < 2 seconds
- Interactive element response: < 500ms
- Mobile performance within 2x of desktop
