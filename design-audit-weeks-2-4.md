## Step 2: Detailed Analysis

### üéØ User Flow & Information Architecture

#### Current State Issues
**CRITICAL Issues:**
- **Assessment Flow Confusion**: Users must click "Start Quiz" button to access actual quiz content, but preview shows no clear indication of this interaction requirement
- **Navigation Cognitive Load**: 13-week sidebar navigation overwhelming for focused task completion
- **Content Hierarchy Unclear**: Daily sections blend together without clear progressive structure

**HIGH Priority Issues:**
- **Mobile Navigation Problems**: Sidebar likely unusable on mobile devices
- **Assessment Preview Misleading**: Rich preview content suggests interactive elements that aren't immediately available
- **Task Completion Ambiguity**: No clear indication of progress through daily content

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **Assessment Flow Redesign**: Replace preview with direct access pattern
2. **Progressive Navigation**: Implement collapsed/focused navigation states
3. **Clear Content Progression**: Add visual progress indicators and completion states

### üìê Visual Hierarchy & Layout

#### Current State Issues
**HIGH Priority Issues:**
- **Inconsistent Visual Weight**: Assessment sections don't clearly stand out from educational content
- **Typography Scale Problems**: Similar text sizes for different levels of information
- **Spacing Inconsistencies**: Variable gaps between sections create visual confusion

**MEDIUM Priority Issues:**
- **Grid System Misalignment**: Topic cards and activity items lack consistent proportional relationships
- **Interactive Element Recognition**: Assessment buttons don't clearly indicate their interactive nature

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **Enhanced Typography Scale**: Implement clearer heading hierarchy
2. **Assessment Section Emphasis**: Distinctive styling for assessment areas
3. **Consistent Spacing System**: Apply systematic spacing scale throughout

### üîó Interaction Design & Navigation

#### Current State Issues
**CRITICAL Issues:**
- **Hidden Functionality**: Assessment interactions not discoverable without clicking buttons
- **No Loading States**: Assessment loading may appear broken to users
- **Tab State Confusion**: Assessment tabs don't clearly show which is active/completed

**HIGH Priority Issues:**
- **Mobile Touch Targets**: Interactive elements may be too small for mobile use
- **Keyboard Navigation Missing**: No clear tab order or keyboard accessibility
- **Feedback Absence**: No confirmation of successful actions

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show assessment options more clearly
2. **Enhanced Loading States**: Add proper loading indicators and transitions
3. **Clear Interactive Feedback**: Implement hover states, focus states, and completion indicators

### üé® Visual Design & Branding

#### Current State Issues
**MEDIUM Priority Issues:**
- **Brand Identity Weak**: Baseball theme present but not strongly reinforced
- **Color Usage Inconsistent**: Primary colors not systematically applied
- **Icon System Scattered**: Emoji used inconsistently with varying purposes

**LOW Priority Issues:**
- **Visual Monotony**: Repetitive card layouts without variation
- **Insufficient Visual Interest**: Lack of engaging visual elements beyond basic cards

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **Strengthen Baseball Branding**: Consistent color scheme and baseball-specific design elements
2. **Systematic Color Application**: Use brand colors meaningfully throughout interface
3. **Enhanced Visual Interest**: Add subtle animations and improved graphics

### ‚ôø Accessibility & Performance

#### Current State Issues
**CRITICAL Issues:**
- **Color-Only Information**: Difficulty badges use only color to convey meaning
- **Missing Alt Text**: Interactive elements lack proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation Broken**: Assessment interactions not keyboard accessible

**HIGH Priority Issues:**
- **Focus Management**: No clear focus indicators for interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Assessment content structure not properly announced
- **Contrast Issues**: Some text-background combinations may not meet WCAG standards

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **WCAG Compliance**: Ensure all color combinations meet AA standards
2. **Proper ARIA Implementation**: Add semantic markup for assistive technologies
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Implement complete keyboard interaction support
